# Auto Vision - Real-Time Vehicle Detection

## Project Overview
**Auto Vision** is a real-time vehicle detection model built using YOLOv8 and trained on a labeled dataset from Roboflow. This model identifies and labels various vehicle types in images, video files, and live video streams. **Auto Vision** is ideal for applications like traffic monitoring, autonomous driving systems, and vehicle tracking, providing accurate detection across diverse environments.

## Features
- **Real-Time Detection**: Detects vehicles in live video streams, instantly highlighting and labeling them.
- **Versatile Input Support**: Works with images, video files, and live video feeds.
- **Accurate Classification**: Labels each detected vehicle with bounding boxes, specifying vehicle types.

## Technologies Used
- **YOLOv8** - For object detection model architecture
- **Roboflow** - For dataset labeling and management
- **Python** - Primary language used in model development and deployment
