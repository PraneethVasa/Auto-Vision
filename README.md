# Auto Vision - Real-Time Vehicle Detection

## Project Overview
**Auto Vision** is a real-time vehicle detection model built using YOLOv8 and trained on a labeled dataset from Roboflow. This model identifies and labels various vehicle types in images, video files, and live video streams. **Auto Vision** is ideal for applications like traffic monitoring, autonomous driving systems, and vehicle tracking, providing accurate detection across diverse environments.
